# ChurnAnalysis

The objective of this SQL code is to classify the company's merchants/clients according to their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) in order to find the best customers taking into account their last transactiom, the frequency of purchases and the value of these purchases.

This helped the company understand their customers and segmentate them in order to create more personalised communications and marketing campaigns for each one of them. This helped increase the engagement value by making the customers feel more heard and understood.
The resulting views from this query would then be used to create a Tableau dashboard for the Marketing and Analytics Teams.
