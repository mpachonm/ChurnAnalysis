# ChurnAnalysis

The objective of this SQL code is to classify the company's merchants/clients according to their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) in order to find the best customers taking into account their last transactiom, the frequency of purchases and the value of these purchases.

This helped the company understand their customers and segmentate them in order to create more personalised communications and marketing campaigns for each one of them. This helped increase the engagement value by making the customers feel more heard and understood.

The type of merchant by the products they sell (technology, finance, home appliances, etc) was also used in this segmentation, as well as the distribution of payment methods (cash, credit, debit) within their transactions.

A second objective of this code was to classify merchants in any of the following: active, dormant or churners. The first one being merchants with transactions within the last 3 months, dormant being those having their last transaction between 3 and 6 months from today and churners were those with no transactions in the last 6 months.

Different communications, mostly emails, were sent to each type of merchants. For those being classified as churners more extensive communication methods, such as phone calls, were used.

The resulting views from this query would then be used to create a Tableau dashboard for the Marketing and Analytics Teams.
